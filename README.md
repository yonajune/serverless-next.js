### Motivation

Since Nextjs 8.0, [serverless mode](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-8#serverless-nextjs) was introduced which provides a new low level API which projects like this can use to deploy onto different cloud providers. This project is a better version of the [serverless plugin](https://github.com/danielcondemarin/serverless-next.js/tree/master/packages/serverless-nextjs-plugin) which focuses on addressing core issues like [next 9 support](https://github.com/danielcondemarin/serverless-nextjs-plugin/issues/101), [better development experience](https://github.com/danielcondemarin/serverless-nextjs-plugin/issues/59), [the 200 CloudFormation resource limit](https://github.com/danielcondemarin/serverless-nextjs-plugin/issues/17) and [performance](https://github.com/danielcondemarin/serverless-nextjs-plugin/issues/13).

### Design principles

1. Zero configuration by default

There is no configuration needed. You can extend defaults based on your application needs.

2. Feature parity with nextjs

Users of this component should be able to use nextjs development tooling, aka `next dev`. It is the component's job to deploy your application ensuring parity with all of next's features we know and love. Below you can find a list of the features that are currently supported.

3. Fast deployments / no CloudFormation resource limits.

With a simplified architecture and no use of CloudFormation, there are no limits to how many pages you can have in your application, plus deployment times are very fast! with the exception of CloudFront propagation times of course.

### Features

- [x] [Server side rendered pages at the Edge](https://github.com/zeit/next.js#fetching-data-and-component-lifecycle).
      Pages that need server side compute to render are hosted on Lambda@Edge. The component takes care of all the routing for you so there is no configuration needed. Because rendering happens at the CloudFront edge locations latency is very low!
- [x] [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs#api-routes).
      Similarly to the server side rendered pages, API requests are also served from the CloudFront edge locations using Lambda@Edge.
- [x] [Dynamic pages / route segments](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/#dynamic-routing).
- [x] [Catch all routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes).
- [x] [Automatic prerendering](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/#automatic-prerendering).
      Statically optimised pages compiled by next are served from CloudFront edge locations with low latency and cost.
- [x] [Client assets](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/#cdn-support-with-asset-prefix).
      Nextjs build assets `/_next/*` served from CloudFront.
- [x] [User static / public folders](https://github.com/zeit/next.js#static-file-serving-eg-images).
      Any of your assets in the static or public folders are uploaded to S3 and served from CloudFront automatically.
- [x] [Opt-in to static generation (SSG)](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation) via `getStaticProps`.
- [x] [Opt-in to server-side rendering (SSR)](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getserversideprops-server-side-rendering) via `getServerSideProps`.
- [x] [Statically generate a set of routes from dynamic sources](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticpaths-static-generation) via `getStaticPaths`.
- [x] [Base path](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/basepath) available on current `alpha` release.
- [ ] [Optional catch all routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes#optional-catch-all-routes)
- [ ] [Rewrites](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/rewrites)
- [ ] Preview mode. See [RFC](https://github.com/danielcondemarin/serverless-next.js/issues/355) for updates.

### Getting started

Add your next application to the serverless.yml:

```yml
# serverless.yml

myNextApplication:
  component: "thrive-serverless-component@{version_here}" # it is recommended you pin the latest stable version of serverless-next.js
```

Set your AWS credentials as environment variables:

```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=accesskey
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=sshhh
```

And simply deploy:

```bash
$ serverless
```

:no_entry_sign: **Don't attempt to deploy by running `serverless deploy`, use only `serverless`**

### Custom domain name

In most cases you wouldn't want to use CloudFront's distribution domain to access your application. Instead, you can specify a custom domain name.

You can use any domain name but you must be using AWS Route53 for your DNS hosting. To migrate DNS records from an existing domain follow the instructions
[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/MigratingDNS.html). The requirements to use a custom domain name:

- Route53 must include a _hosted zone_ for your domain (e.g. `mydomain.com`) with a set of nameservers.
- You must update the nameservers listed with your domain name registrar (e.g. namecheap, godaddy, etc.) with those provided for your new _hosted zone_.

The serverless next.js component will automatically generate an SSL certificate and create a new record to point to your CloudFront distribution.

```yml
# serverless.yml

myNextApplication:
  component: serverless-next.js
  inputs:
    domain: "example.com" # sub-domain defaults to www
```

You can also configure a `subdomain`:

```yml
# serverless.yml

myNextApplication:
  component: serverless-next.js
  inputs:
    domain: ["sub", "example.com"] # [ sub-domain, domain ]
```

### Custom CloudFront configuration

To specify your own CloudFront inputs, just add any [aws-cloudfront inputs](https://github.com/serverless-components/aws-cloudfront#3-configure) under `cloudfront`:

```yml
# serverless.yml

myNextApplication:
  component: serverless-next.js
  inputs:
    cloudfront:
      # this is the default cache behaviour of the cloudfront distribution
      # the origin-request edge lambda associated to this cache behaviour does the pages server side rendering
      defaults:
        forward:
          headers:
            [
              CloudFront-Is-Desktop-Viewer,
              CloudFront-Is-Mobile-Viewer,
              CloudFront-Is-Tablet-Viewer,
            ]
      # this is the cache behaviour for next.js api pages
      api:
        ttl: 10
      # you can set other cache behaviours like "defaults" above that can handle server side rendering
      # but more specific for a subset of your next.js pages
      /blog/*:
        ttl: 1000
        forward:
          cookies: "all"
          queryString: false
      /about:
        ttl: 3000
      # you can add custom origins to the cloudfront distribution
      origins:
        - url: /static
          pathPatterns:
            /wp-content/*:
              ttl: 10
        - url: https://old-static.com
          pathPatterns:
            /old-static/*:
              ttl: 10
      priceClass: "PriceClass_100"
```

This is particularly useful for caching any of your next.js pages at CloudFront's edge locations. See [this](https://github.com/danielcondemarin/serverless-next.js/tree/master/packages/serverless-component/examples/app-with-custom-caching-config) for an example application with custom cache configuration.

### Static pages caching

Statically rendered pages (i.e. HTML pages that are uploaded to S3) have the following Cache-Control set:

```
cache-control: public, max-age=0, s-maxage=2678400, must-revalidate
```

`s-maxage` allows Cloudfront to cache the pages at the edge locations for 31 days.
`max-age=0` in combination with `must-revalidate` ensure browsers never cache the static pages. This allows Cloudfront to be in full control of caching TTLs. On every deployment an invalidation`/*` is created to ensure users get fresh content.

### Public directory caching

By default, common image formats(`gif|jpe?g|jp2|tiff|png|webp|bmp|svg|ico`) under `/public` or `/static` folders
have a one-year `Cache-Control` policy applied(`public, max-age=31536000, must-revalidate`).
You may customize either the `Cache-Control` header `value` and the regex of which files to `test`, with `publicDirectoryCache`:

```yaml
myNextApplication:
  component: serverless-next.js
  inputs:
    publicDirectoryCache:
      value: public, max-age=604800
      test: /\.(gif|jpe?g|png|txt|xml)$/i
```

`value` must be a valid `Cache-Control` policy and `test` must be a valid `regex` of the types of files you wish to test.
If you don't want browsers to cache assets from the public directory, you can disable this:

```yaml
myNextApplication:
  component: serverless-next.js
  inputs:
    publicDirectoryCache: false
```

### AWS Permissions

By default the Lambda@Edge functions run using AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole which only allows uploading logs to CloudWatch. If you need permissions beyond this, like for example access to DynamoDB or any other AWS resource you will need your own custom policy arn:

```yml
# serverless.yml

myNextApplication:
  component: serverless-next.js
  inputs:
    policy: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/MyCustomPolicy"
```

Make sure you add CloudWatch log permissions to your custom policy.

### Lambda At Edge Configuration

Both **default** and **api** edge lambdas will be assigned 512mb of memory by default. This value can be altered by assigning a number to the `memory` input

```yml
# serverless.yml

myNextApplication:
  component: serverless-next.js
  inputs:
    memory: 1024
```

Values for **default** and **api** lambdas can be separately defined by assigning `memory` to an object like so:

```yml
# serverless.yml

myNextApplication:
  component: serverless-next.js
  inputs:
    memory:
      defaultLambda: 1024
      apiLambda: 2048
```

The same pattern can be followed for specifying the Node.js runtime (nodejs12.x by default):

```yml
# serverless.yml

myNextApplication:
  component: serverless-next.js
  inputs:
    runtime:
      defaultLambda: "nodejs10.x"
      apiLambda: "nodejs10.x"
```

Similarly, the timeout by default is 10 seconds. To customise you can:

```yml
# serverless.yml

myNextApplication:
  component: serverless-next.js
  inputs:
    timeout:
      defaultLambda: 20
      apiLambda: 15
```

Note the maximum timeout allowed for Lambda@Edge is 30 seconds. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-requirements-limits.html

You can also set a custom name for **default** and **api** lambdas - if not the default is set by the [aws-lambda serverless component](https://github.com/serverless-components/aws-lambda) to the resource id:

```yml
# serverless.yml

myNextApplication:
  component: serverless-next.js
  inputs:
    name:
      defaultLambda: fooDefaultLambda
      apiLambda: fooApiLambda
```

### Architecture

![architecture](./arch_no_grid.png)

Four Cache Behaviours are created in CloudFront.

The first two `_next/*` and `static/*` forward the requests to S3.

The third is associated to a lambda function which is responsible for handling three types of requests.

1. Server side rendered page. Any page that defines `getInitialProps` method will be rendered at this level and the response is returned immediately to the user.

2. Statically optimised page. Requests to pages that were pre-compiled by next to HTML are forwarded to S3.

3. Public resources. Requests to root level resources like `/robots.txt`, `/favicon.ico`, `/manifest.json`, etc. These are forwarded to S3.

The reason why 2. and 3. have to go through Lambda@Edge first is because the routes don't conform to a pattern like `_next/*` or `static/*`. Also, one cache behaviour per route is a bad idea because CloudFront only allows [25 per distribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-limits.html#limits-web-distributions).

The fourth cache behaviour handles next API requests `api/*`.

Custom inputs can be configured like this:

```yaml
myNextApp:
  component: serverless-next.js
  inputs:
    bucketName: my-bucket
```

### FAQ

#### My component doesn't deploy

Make sure your `serverless.yml` uses the `serverless-components` format. [serverless components](https://serverless.com/blog/what-are-serverless-components-how-use/) differ from the original serverless framework, even though they are both accessible via the same CLI.

:white_check_mark: **Do**

```yml
# serverless.yml
myNextApp:
  component: serverless-next.js

myTable:
  component: serverless/aws-dynamodb
  inputs:
    name: Customers
# other components
```

:no_entry_sign: **Don't**

```yml
# serverless.yml
provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs10.x
  region: eu-west-1

myNextApp:
  component: serverless-next.js

Resources: ...
```

Note how the correct yaml doesn't declare a `provider`, `Resources`, etc.

For deploying, don't run `serverless deploy`. Simply run `serverless` and that deploys your components declared in the `serverless.yml` file.

For more information about serverless components go [here](https://serverless.com/blog/what-are-serverless-components-how-use/).

#### Should I use the [serverless-plugin](https://github.com/danielcondemarin/serverless-next.js/tree/master/packages/serverless-plugin) or this component?

Users are encouraged to use this component instead of the `serverless-plugin`. This component was built and designed using lessons learned from the serverless plugin.

#### How do I interact with other AWS Services within my app?

See `examples/dynamodb-crud` for an example Todo application that interacts with DynamoDB. You can find a full list of examples [here](https://github.com/serverless-nextjs/serverless-next.js/tree/master/packages/serverless-component/examples)

#### [CI/CD] A new CloudFront distribution is created on every CI build. I wasn't expecting that

You need to commit your application state in source control. That is the files under the `.serverless` directory. Alternatively you could use S3 to store the `.serverless` files, see an example [here](https://gist.github.com/hadynz/b4e190e0ce10e5811cb462920a9c678f)

The serverless team is currently working on remote state storage so this won't be necessary in the future.

#### My lambda is deployed to `us-east-1`. How can I deploy it to another region?

Serverless next.js is _regionless_. By design, `serverless-next.js` applications will be deployed across the globe to every CloudFront edge location. The lambda might look like is only deployed to `us-east-1` but behind the scenes, it is replicated to every other region.

#### I require passing additional information into my build

See the sample below for an advanced `build` setup that includes passing additional arguments and environment variables to the build.

```yml
# serverless.yml
myDatabase:
  component: MY_DATABASE_COMPNENT
myNextApp:
  component: serverless-next.js
  build:
    args: ["build", "custom/path/to/pages"]
    env:
      DATABASE_URL: ${myDatabase.databaseUrl}
```

#### I was expecting for automatic subdomain redirection when using the domainType: www/apex input

The redirection is not currently implemented, but there is a manual workaround outlined [here](https://simonecarletti.com/blog/2016/08/redirect-domain-https-amazon-cloudfront/#configuring-the-amazon-s3-static-site-with-redirect).
In summary, you will have to create a new S3 bucket and set it up with static website hosting to redirect requests to your supported subdomain type (ex. "www.example.com" or "example.com"). To be able to support HTTPS redirects, you'll need to set up a CloudFront distribution with the S3 redirect bucket as the origin. Finally, you'll need to create an "A" record in Route 53 with your newly created CloudFront distribution as the alias target.
